# INF112 Hanbrekket



## How to play
Run the Main.java file

### Controls
Press C to bring up the available cards and Enter to chose a card (Note: the game crashes if you attempt to chose one of the "empty" cards)
After putting cardss into the register you can execute a phase using Space (Note: since we're lacking a doRound() method the game crashes if you attempt to do this more than five times or more than the amount of cards in the register).
